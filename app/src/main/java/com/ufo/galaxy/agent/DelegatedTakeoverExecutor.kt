/**
 * **Canonical Android-side delegated receipt-to-local-takeover executor binding** (PR-12
 * / PR-13, post-#533 dual-repo runtime unification master plan — Canonical Android-Side
 * Delegated Execution Signal Emission Path, Android side).
 *
 * [DelegatedTakeoverExecutor] is the single authoritative component that bridges an
 * accepted delegated receipt — a [DelegatedRuntimeUnit] and its initial
 * [DelegatedActivationRecord] — into the real local execution / takeover pipeline,
 * while maintaining canonical lifecycle continuity through [DelegatedExecutionTracker]
 * and emitting [DelegatedExecutionSignal] events at each lifecycle milestone.
 *
 * ## Design intent
 *
 * Before PR-12 the Android-side models for receipt, activation, and execution-tracking
 * existed as isolated layers: [DelegatedRuntimeReceiver] produced a
 * [DelegatedActivationRecord]; [DelegatedExecutionTracker] and [DelegatedExecutionSignal]
 * were well-defined models but were never instantiated or emitted in the actual execution
 * path; and [com.ufo.galaxy.service.GalaxyConnectionService.handleTakeoverRequest] managed
 * execution ad-hoc with direct inline state mutations.
 *
 * [DelegatedTakeoverExecutor] closes this gap by:
 *
 *  1. Creating a [DelegatedExecutionTracker] from the initial [DelegatedActivationRecord]
 *     (PENDING) so there is a single, stable, immutable-chain representation of the
 *     execution state from receipt to terminal result.
 *  2. Emitting a [DelegatedExecutionSignal.Kind.ACK] signal immediately after tracker
 *     creation so the main-repo host can distinguish "Android acknowledged the unit"
 *     from "Android is executing" and "Android has a final result".
 *  3. Advancing the tracker through the full canonical lifecycle:
 *     ```
 *     PENDING → (ack emitted) → ACTIVATING → ACTIVE → (progress emitted) → COMPLETED / FAILED
 *     ```
 *  4. Emitting a [DelegatedExecutionSignal.Kind.PROGRESS] signal when execution enters the
 *     ACTIVE state (before the pipeline is called).  This gives the main-repo host at least
 *     one mid-execution update confirming that Android is actively running the delegated unit.
 *  5. Emitting a [DelegatedExecutionSignal.Kind.RESULT] signal at the terminal step, with
 *     the correct [DelegatedExecutionSignal.ResultKind]:
 *     - [DelegatedExecutionSignal.ResultKind.COMPLETED] on success.
 *     - [DelegatedExecutionSignal.ResultKind.TIMEOUT] when a
 *       [kotlinx.coroutines.TimeoutCancellationException] is thrown by the pipeline.
 *     - [DelegatedExecutionSignal.ResultKind.CANCELLED] when a
 *       [kotlinx.coroutines.CancellationException] (non-timeout) is thrown by the pipeline.
 *     - [DelegatedExecutionSignal.ResultKind.FAILED] for all other exceptions.
 *  6. Preserving identity continuity — `unitId`, `taskId`, `traceId`,
 *     `attachedSessionId`, and `handoffContractVersion` — on every emitted signal so
 *     the main-repo tracker can correlate signals across the entire lifecycle.
 *  6. Returning a typed [ExecutionOutcome] so callers no longer need inline try/catch
 *     logic: [ExecutionOutcome.Completed] carries the [GoalResultPayload] and final
 *     tracker; [ExecutionOutcome.Failed] carries the error message and final tracker.
 *
 * ## Relationship to surrounding components
 *
 * ```
 * DelegatedRuntimeReceiver  ─── receipt accepted
 *        │
 *        │  DelegatedRuntimeUnit + DelegatedActivationRecord(PENDING)
 *        ▼
 * DelegatedTakeoverExecutor ─── manages lifecycle + emits signals
 *        │                               │
 *        │ GoalExecutionPipeline         │ DelegatedExecutionSignalSink
 *        ▼                               ▼
 * AutonomousExecutionPipeline       structured ACK / RESULT signals
 *        │
 *        ▼
 * GoalResultPayload ──▶ ExecutionOutcome (returned to GalaxyConnectionService)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Testability
 *
 * Both [GoalExecutionPipeline] and [DelegatedExecutionSignalSink] are functional
 * interfaces and can be supplied as lambdas in unit tests without an Android framework
 * or a real WebSocket connection.
 *
 * @param pipeline   The local goal-execution pipeline; in production this delegates to
 *                   [AutonomousExecutionPipeline.handleGoalExecution].
 * @param signalSink Receives [DelegatedExecutionSignal] events emitted during the
 *                   execution lifecycle (ACK and RESULT); in production this is wired to
 *                   structured logging and future outbound signal transmission.

     *
     * 1. Creates [DelegatedExecutionTracker] from [initialRecord] (must be in PENDING).
     * 2. Emits [DelegatedExecutionSignal.Kind.ACK] via [signalSink].
     * 3. Advances tracker: marks execution started + transitions to ACTIVATING.

     *    [SourceRuntimePosture.JOIN_RUNTIME] (delegated work is always executed as a
     *    joined runtime participant on Android).
     * 5. Advances tracker to ACTIVE — emits [DelegatedExecutionSignal.Kind.PROGRESS] to
     *    inform the host that the pipeline is about to be entered.
     * 6. Calls [GoalExecutionPipeline.executeGoal].
     *    - **On success**: records a step, advances to COMPLETED, emits RESULT signal
     *      with [DelegatedExecutionSignal.ResultKind.COMPLETED], returns
     *      [ExecutionOutcome.Completed].
     *    - **On [TimeoutCancellationException]**: advances to FAILED, emits RESULT signal
     *      with [DelegatedExecutionSignal.ResultKind.TIMEOUT], returns
     *      [ExecutionOutcome.Failed].
     *    - **On [CancellationException]**: advances to FAILED, emits RESULT signal
     *      with [DelegatedExecutionSignal.ResultKind.CANCELLED], returns
     *      [ExecutionOutcome.Failed].
     *    - **On other [Exception]**: advances to FAILED, emits RESULT signal with
